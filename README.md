### Hi there üëã

My name is **Gang He** and I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Technology and Society](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/est/people/core_faculty/ghe.php) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu). I use Github mostly for modeling and paper data sharing. I also share collections of repositories that help me in my research or daily life. You can find out more about my research at: [www.ganghe.net](https://www.ganghe.net).
