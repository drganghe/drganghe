### Hi there üëã

My name is **Gang He** and I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Technology and Society](https://www.stonybrook.edu/est/) @ [SBU](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). I use Github mostly for modeling and paper data sharing. I plan to share collections of repository that helps me in my research. Find out more at my website: [ganghe.net](https://www.ganghe.net/).
